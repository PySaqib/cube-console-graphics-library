# Cube

Cube is a super light-weight and beginner oriented graphics module that can be used in C++. It is tailored to be used by individuals who are just starting out to code in C++ and want to make minimal graphical projects.

This documentation extensively covers the implementation of the functions. Furthermore, if you have any questions, you can drop them right away on GitHub.


## Installation

The installation of Cube only requires you to download the (cube.cpp) file from GitHub and then proceed to pasting the entire code into your project. You can also create a separate file and use the #include directive.

Currently, the library only works for Windows machines as it uses Windows.h as the primary dependency.

## Implemented Features

I am currently migrating the code to much dynamic approach as the current approach was not sufficiently flexible.
